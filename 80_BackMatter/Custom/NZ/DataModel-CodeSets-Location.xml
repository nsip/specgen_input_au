				<Text>Thoroughfare</Text>
				<Description>
					<p>Also called 'Street' addresses, The most
					general, and widely used type of address, and can
					contain the widest variety of components.</p>
					
					<p>In general a thoroughfare address will include
					components for a number, a roadname, and a
					locality.</p>
					
					<p>They cannot contain any of the components
					specific to a delivery service, rural post
					delivery, or water address.</p>
					
					<p>These addresses are used to find a location.</p>
					<p><em>Example:</em> 30 - 40 Lambton Quay, Wellington, 6165</p>

				<Code>2</Code>
				<Text>Rural</Text>
				<Description>
					<p>Defined by New Zealand Post, these addresses
					are assigned by NZ Post for customers who purchase
					a rural delivery service (mail and also other
					goods).</p>

					<p>They will have the same number and roadname
					components as the street address, and may have the
					same region component.</p>
					
					<p>They do not have a component that identifies
					the locality the address is within. The locality
					and city or town components are replaced by
					components that identify the rural delivery route
					(RD number), and the town from which the rural
					delivery route starts and finishes (the mail
					town). Only addresses of this class can contain
					these components.
