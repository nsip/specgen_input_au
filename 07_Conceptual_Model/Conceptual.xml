	<h2>Conceptual Model 3.4.6</h2>
	<p>The conceptual model uses UML conventions. Each class corresponds to one or more SIF objects. Abstract classes, which generalise from classes, are used to capture relations more economically; they are <em>italicised</em>.</p>
	
	<h2>Enrolment</h2>
	<p>The following are the primary objects involved in enrolling a student onto school systems.</p>
	<p><img src="images/Cenrolment.png" alt="" /></p>
	<p>The following includes secondary objects which may also be invoked during student enrolment (shaded grey).</p>

		<h2>Account Provisioning</h2>
	<p>The grey arrows point to superclasses; e.g. Party is a superclass of Teacher, Parent, and Student. The dotted entity Party is not represented separately in the SIF AU data model; a common type contains Personal information.</p>
	<p>Relations whose logical representation will be deprecated in SIF-AU 3.5 are marked in red.</p>
