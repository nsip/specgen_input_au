	<h2>Conceptual Model 3.4.8</h2>
	<p>The conceptual model is at the level of entities and relations between them; attributes are not listed. All objects in the Australian data model are represented; some objects are represented as relations between entities, rather than as distinct entities.
For clarity, the conceptual model is broken up into use cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li> 	Enrolment</li>
	<li>    Account Provisioning</li>
	<li>	Timetable/Attendance</li>
	<li>	Finance/Resources</li>
	<li>	NAPLAN</li>
	<li>	Wellbeing</li>
	<li>	Classroom Assessment</li>
	<li>	Scheduling</li>
	<li>	Statistics</li>
	<li>	Teaching and Learning</li>
	<li>	Reporting Collections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Entity Diagram/Table Conventions</h2>
<p>Entities are named with names that the schools sector business can relate to readily, rather than the current names of SIF AU objects.</p>
<p>The conceptual model uses UML conventions. Each class corresponds to one or more SIF objects. Abstract classes, which generalise from classes, are used to capture relations more economically; they are <em>italicised</em> in the diagrams.</p>
<p>Relations between classes, which correspond to SIF objects, are italicised in the Entity tables.</p>
<p>Alternatives are indicated with semicolon. Refinements/context on alternatives are indicated by <em>italics</em> and prefix. A colon is used to introduce the context in which an alternative representation is applicable.</p>
	
<h2>Relation Table Conventions</h2>	
<p>The comma-delimited objects enumerated are the set of objects which together represent the relationship, including the two objects containing the join attribute and the object joining the two, where applicable.</p>
<p>If an object is optional for the relation to be expressed, it is put in brackets.</p>	
<p>If two objects are alternatives for each other in the relation presented, they are represented by { Object1, Object 2 }. (See Account Provisioning, for instance).</p>
<p>If there are multiple sets of objects which represent the relationship, they are semicolon-delimited: “A, B, C; Y, Z”. </p>
<p>Some objects are highly denormalised, to the extent that they contain data about both entities being related; in such cases, only a single object is needed to represent the relation.</p>


	<h2>Enrolment</h2>
	<p>The following are the primary objects involved in enrolling a student onto school systems.</p>
	<p><img src="images/Conceptual_enrolment.png" alt="" /></p>
	<p>The following includes secondary objects which may also be invoked during student enrolment (shaded grey).</p>
