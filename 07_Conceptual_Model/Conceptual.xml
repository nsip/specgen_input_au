	<h2>Conceptual Model 3.4.6</h2>
	<p>The conceptual model is at the level of entities and relations between them; attributes are not listed. All objects in the Australian data model are represented; some objects are represented as relations between entities, rather than as distinct entities.
For clarity, the conceptual model is broken up into use cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li> 	Enrolment</li>
	<li>    Account Provisioning</li>
	<li>	Timetable/Attendance</li>
	<li>	Finance/Resources</li>
	<li>	NAPLAN</li>
	<li>	Wellbeing</li>
	<li>	Classroom Assessment</li>
	<li>	Scheduling</li>
	<li>	Statistics</li>
	<li>	Teaching and Learning</li>
	<li>	Reporting Collections</li>
</ul>
<p>Entities are named with names that the schools sector business can relate to readily, rather than the current names of SIF AU objects.</p>
	<p>The conceptual model uses UML conventions. Each class corresponds to one or more SIF objects. Abstract classes, which generalise from classes, are used to capture relations more economically; they are <em>italicised</em>.</p>
	
	<h2>Enrolment</h2>
	<p>The following are the primary objects involved in enrolling a student onto school systems.</p>
	<p><img src="images/Conceptual_enrolment.png" alt="" /></p>
	<p>The following includes secondary objects which may also be invoked during student enrolment (shaded grey).</p>
